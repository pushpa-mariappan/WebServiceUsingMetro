Metro is for implementing jaxws for enterprise. Implementation jar is avaliable separately, which needs to be downloaded.
https://metro.java.net/2.3.1/. 
Jaxwsri and metro implementation are same. Only the dependency jars will differ for each implementation.
You need to include them in WEB-INF\lib folder. 
In eclipse, create dynamic web project, add metro lib in WEB-INF\lib folder
Create the SEI and SIB classes
Change the web.xml, to give skeleton url. Skeleton will be the java servlet.
Configure  web service enpoint url in sun-jaxws.xml(which is the webservice config file for jaxws-ri based webservice)
Run the SIB class to deploy the webservice.
Get the wsdl from endpointurl?wsdl
For Client:
create again a dynamic web project
generate the stub using wsimport giving the wsdl url with -keep to get the .java files
copy the generated class to project src folder.(SEI, SIB, two class for each operation, ObjectFactory and package-info)
create the client class.
run client as java application and get the output printed.
